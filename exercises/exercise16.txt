 Password Generator     
Exercise 16 (and Solution)
Note: this is a 4-chili exercise, not because it introduces a concept, but because this exercise is more like a project. Feel free to skip this and come back when you’re more ready!
Write a password generator in Python. Be creative with how you generate passwords - strong passwords have a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The passwords should be random, generating a new password every time the user asks for a new password. Include your run-time code in a main method.
Extra:
Ask the user how strong they want their password to be. For weak passwords, pick a word or two from a list.
Discussion
There are no new topics this week, but you will need to use Python’s random module, described in this post.
Happy coding!
